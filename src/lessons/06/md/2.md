## String concatenation

OK, let's say we are inside a function but we need to join that string value with another before returning it. How do we do that?

Well, as you probably noticed from the examples above, we can *join* multiple values together by using the plus symbol (`+`) just like you would in a calculator. This is called **string concatenation**. Basically a fancy way of saying stick two string values together.

However, remember that there is no thing such as a typo checker in Javascript. If you join two strings together without an extra space character in there, you'll get two strings next to each other.

That's why if we look at the function in our example above again, you'll notice we are adding extra strings in between our variables with different characters like commas, spaces and periods in order to create a grammatically correct sentence.

The More You Know: What would happen if you tried to use the `+` for two numbers instead? Can you guess? Yep, just like a calculator, you'd get their added value since they are both number types. If they were 2 *strings* however (e.g. `'5' + '2'` instead of `5 + 2`) you'd get a string with the value `52`. That's why it's important to know what type of values you are trying to add together!
