## The Hero We Don't Deserve
Now look at the example below. The same node selection but with jQuery instead:

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn');
~~~

Yes, the almighty `$` symbol is the way to access the power of jQuery. [Once you have loaded the jQuery library](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-jquery) before your own script file and right before the end of the `</body>` tag, you'll be able to use jQuery's magic in this way.

The `$` symbold followed by an opening `(` and closing `)` is how you tell jQuery that you are looking to create a specific DOM node selection. What goes inside is the CSS selector you want in between single or double quotes (I'm a single-quotes-man myself). And just like CSS, remember you can also target it with any valid CSS selector (i.e. `button`);

However, it's always better to be more specific when starting out. If the CSS selector you are looking for is too general, you can unwillingly create bugs for yourself.

For example, if you had more than two `button` elements on the page and you were trying to target the second one with just a `button` jQuery selector instead of using a more specific ID or class, jQuery would create a list of all matching nodes that use the `button` HTML selector, instead of the button you are looking for. [***VERIFY THIS!***]

But is that it? Do we just use jQuery because it's easier to read and faster to write?

Not *quite*.

Here's the real jQuery magic: By creating a node in this way, we are *wrapping* our little basic Javascript node **inside an object**. A very special and powerful jQuery-powered object in this case that allows you to do all kinds of fun stuff with very little jQuery code.

**That's** where jQuery shines and why it's still the people's champ of the Javascript world today.
