## Return statement

We briefly mentioned above that the `return` statement basically does exactly that: it returns a value from inside the function. In other words, it returns our function's *output* value.

This returned output can then be used in a variety of ways depending on the task you are trying to accomplish of course.

One critical thing to keep in mind though: When you *return* a value from inside a function, Javascript will immediately **quit** our function.

In other words, any other code below your return statement will *never* get executed.

~~~js
function sayHello(name){
  var output = 'Hi, my name is ' + yourName;
  
  return output;
  
  console.log('You will never see this in the console.');
}

sayHello('John');
~~~

You'll find out a bit later why this is extremely useful.
