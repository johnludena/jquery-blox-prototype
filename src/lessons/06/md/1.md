## Writing with plain vanilla JS can be a murder for your carpal tunnel sometimes.

When using good ol' plain Javascript without any fancy upgrades or libraries means that creating a DOM node requires a lot more typing that it should. At least compared to a library like jQuery.

For example, let's pretend we have the following HTML:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

Clicking this button will trigger a hidden modal popup box (eventually). 

But for now we know that we need to interact with this button *somehow*. Therefore, what's our **very first step** when writing Javascript?

That's right, we need to create a DOM node for it! Unfortunately, without using jQuery, it can get pretty verbose and perhaps even intimidating for a beginner. Let's look at a simple example of this is done in good ol' plain and simple Javascript:

~~~~js
var buttonNode = document.querySelector('.btn');
~~~~

Maybe that's not to bad, but for a lot of newcomers, it's hard for them exactly what they are doing or exactly *why* they are writing things such as `document` or `querySelector`.
