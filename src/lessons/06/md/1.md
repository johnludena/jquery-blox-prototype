## Objective: 

Let's say we have our friend button and we want to run a message as a `console.log` statement when we click it to perform a sanity check in our code and see if the damn file is even running (a common approach to bug development, just FYI.):

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

Using jQuery, attach a 'click' event to this button so the message 'You clicked me' shows up in the console.
