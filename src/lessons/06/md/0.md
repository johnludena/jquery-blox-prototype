## Functions

- Setup: Functions are like recipes. They are just a set of steps that we are grouping together and can call at any time by actually 'running' or 'invoking' said function.

- The problem is that with the rise of ES6 and its fancy arrow syntax, it has completely replaced the keyword `function` itself, really forcing your brain to always stop for a second and figure out what this strange hierogliphics(sp?) are before you understand what is happening.

This has been one place where Javascript has gone one step forward, but two steps back when it comes to adoption by others. So while you still have your training wheels on, we'll focus on writing out functions the ol' fashioned way.

This is what a function looks like:

~~~js
function triggerModalPopup(){
  // inside this safe space we'll write out our instructions to the browser to open a modal  
}

triggerModalPopup(); // and this how we'll call our function when we are ready, but more on that later.
~~~

- Talk a bit about the keword 'function' and the syntax for a function. Talk about creating functions without names -- but that must be stored in a variable name instead -- in order to be called later.

- Talk briefly about 'parameters' and how they resemble an input inside a blender.

- Talk about 'return' and how they resemble what comes out of the end of the pipe.
