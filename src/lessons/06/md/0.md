## Functions

Javascript **functions** work a lot like cooking recipes. Parts of our Javascript code (i.e. our cooking steps) can be grouped *inside* a function, ready to be executed in that precise order when said function is triggered (also referred to as invoking or 'calling' a function). 

Basically, calling a function kick-starts the process of running the code inside that function. In other words, the code inside your function will never execute unless the function gets called *first*.

This is what a function looks like:

~~~js
function bakeCake(){
  // all your code goes inside the curly brackets
  // step 1...
  // step 2...
  // step 3...
  // etc.
}

bakeCake(); // run the function and excutes code inside
~~~

As you can see, we use the keyword `function` followed by the name we want to use for our new function. This is followed by an opening and closing parenthesis (`()`) and then an opening left curly bracket (`{`) where all the steps in our function will reside before closing everything up with a right curly bracket (`}`).

Now, while you can name your function whatever you like, it's good practice and a courtesy to your fellow dev peeps to name the function as an action *verb* that describes exactly what your function *does*. 

For example, if a function opens a modal, don't just call your function `modal` but name it `openModal` instead.

Once your function has been declared, we can actually *call* our function by using the name of the function immediately followed by an opening and closing `()` as you can see in the last line.
