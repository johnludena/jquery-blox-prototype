## Callback Functions

Like we briefly discussed in our previous lessons, a callback function is just a regular ol' function that is an input parameter for another function.

In other words, a callback function only runs after the first function gets triggered.

So now that we have the second piece of the puzzle, let's go back to the initial request we've been tasked with: Writing some code that opens a modal when clicking a certain button.

What would be the next step to make this happen?

Well, we could write it like this:

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn');

function triggerModalPopup(){
  // instructions here to open our super secret modal popup
}

buttonNode.on('click', triggerModalPopup);

~~~

Or if you are feeling confident and want to show off a bit, we could always just ditch the `triggerModalPopup` callback named function and go full mystery mode with an anonymous callback function instead:

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn');

buttonNode.on('click', function(){
	// instructions here to open our super secret modal popup
});
~~~

Make more sense now? Either way is a valid way to write the callback function that will get triggered after the user triggers the 'click' event on our button.

As long as it makes sense to YOU  -- and doesn't make your fellow developers hate you too much -- they are both perfectly acceptable ways of using callback functions.
