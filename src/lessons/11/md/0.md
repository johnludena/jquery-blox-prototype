## Closest and find

OK, I know we've had peanut butter and jelly references already during our time together, but if there was a *real* pair of buddies that go together like PB&J, it's the `closest` and `find` methods.

- Traversing the DOM is hard, but these two guys make it seem so easy. [EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. MENTION THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED IN VANILA JS]

- Now talk about traversing up the DOM with 'closest' and then narrowing down your seach *within* that element for one of its descendants with `find`.
