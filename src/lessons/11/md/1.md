## Objective:

Let's pretend that we have the following HTML below where a user first clicks a button and is shown a signup form. 

~~~html
<button class="btn">Sign up for newsletter</button>
~~~

Write some Javascript that will trigger a callback function called `showSignupForm` after the button is clicked.

PS - You can write a `console.log` statement inside the callback function if you wish but it's not a requirement to pass this test successfully.
