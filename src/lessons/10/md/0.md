## Anonymous functions
While we mentioned in a previous lesson that functions use the keyword `function` followed by a name you come up with, there's also another type of function: A shy type that doesn't have a name...

These are referred to as 'anonymous' functions in Javascript.

Anonymous functions are just functions with no specific name given. They have the following format:

~~~js
function() {
	// Anonymous function logic inside
})
~~~

As you can tell, almost the exact same format as our previously discussed function format, except that these don't have a specific name after the keyword `function`.

HOWEVER, since anonymous functions don't have a name that we can use to actually *invoke* them, they are mostly used as input parameters inside other functions.

Let's go back to the example from the previous chapter. Here's what that would look like if we used an anonymous function instead of a named function:

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn');

buttonNode.on('click', function() {
	console.log('That tickles!');
});
~~~
