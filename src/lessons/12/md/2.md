### Hide

OK, let's go for a double whammy here.

But what if you want to *hide* the modal? Well, let's pretend we have one more button inside of the modal that will close the modal when clicked:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
<div class="modal-popup" style="display: none">
  <p>Your modal content here</p>
  <button class="close-modal">close</button>
</div>
~~~

It's a simple matter of doing the exact same thing as above but attaching another 'click' event listener to a closing button node, only this time instead of using `show`, we'll use `hide` method to set the inline style CSS to `display: none`.

That's literally all there is to `hide`.

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');
  var closeModalButton = $('.close-modal');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').show();
  });

  closeModalButton.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').hide();
  });
~~~~

Boom. How easy is that!

Are you starting to see the power of Javascript and jQuery when used together?
