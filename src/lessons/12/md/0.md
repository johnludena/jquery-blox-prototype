## Become a jQuery magician with show() and hide()

If you take a moment to think about it, almost every interaction on a page is based on hiding and showing stuff.

You click something and then something else appears or disappears.

It's a basic functionality used across multiple types of website elements: Modals, tabs, accordions, sliders, etc. They ALL work on this very simple premise of hiding and showing stuff.

Thankfully, jQuery has several built-in methods that allow us to do this exact thing with very little code. 

Here, we'll be expanding a bit on jQuery's `hide` and `show` methods, which will allow you to turn into a Javascript wizard in making things appear and disappear!
