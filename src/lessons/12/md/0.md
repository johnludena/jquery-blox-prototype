## IF/ELSE

If/else statements are another foundational concept in programming. It's how the browser determines which code blocks to run based on whether a condition has been met or not.

Sometimes understanding everything about if/else can be quite complicated and getting into very muddy waters. We'll try to break down all their parts into simple core ideas in here.

~~~js
var focusedMode = true;

if (focusedMode === true) {
  console.log("No phone cals allowed.");
} else if {
  console.log("Phone calls are OK.")
} else if {
  console.log("Phone calls are OK.")
} else {
  console.log("Phone calls are OK.")
}
~~~

Let's say we want to do a check for a certain condition and only run a block of code if that condition is met. In the example above, we are checking whether the variable `focusedMode` is true or not. In this case it'll always be true but pretend in our app that value can be changed at certain points during a user session.

We use the keyword `if` followed by an opening and closing `()` where we'll put the condition we want to check for -- followed by an opening and closing `{}` where we'll place the code we want to run if that condition is met.

As you can tell in the example above, we use the `===` operator to tell Javascript that we are doing a comparison of values. Remember that up to this point we've only been using a single `=` to *assign* a value. When using 3 `=` symbols together, Javascript will compare the values of both sides and evaluate it to see whether it's true or false.

If the results is true, that code block gets run, otherwise we move on down to the next check to see if that matches. Depending on how many other `else if` blocks you have on your page, it'll keep going down until it matches one.

If there are no matches at all, the program will default to the final `else` block.

- Talk about the difference between the '=' and '===' sign and how one is for assigning a value, and the other is used to compare a value.
- Talk about 'if', 'else if', 'else' and how the browser will run through conditions until it matches one and then execute that block of code.
- Talk a bit about '||' and '&&' inside a condition check.
