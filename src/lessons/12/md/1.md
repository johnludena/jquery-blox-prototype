### Show

First let's take a look at `show`:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
<div class="modal-popup" style="display: none">
  <p>Your modal content here<p>
</div>
~~~

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').show();
  });
~~~~

Hopefully, you can kinda tell what's happening here by now. Your HTML has a button that reads 'learn more' and also an initially hidden modal popup where you'll school the user on some stuff once the button is clicked.

The modal itself is hidden by default on the initial page load due to the inline `style` tag that has `display: none` set. We do this of course because we don't want to show the user the modal right away, only when they trigger it themselves.

So just like we did in a previous lesson, we'll add a `click` event listener to our button, and inside our callback function we'll actually reveal the `.modal-popup` div element.

But how exactly?

Very easy. By using the `show` jQuery method, we are simply setting an element's inline style tag to `display: block`, which will override the current `display: none` style.

Voila! Like magic your `div` will now show up on click.
