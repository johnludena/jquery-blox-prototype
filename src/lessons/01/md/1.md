## Variables

Variables are a fairly simple concept to understand, but since ES6 additions of 'let' and 'const', things have changed a bit and this can throw a curveball for newbies when first learning about creating variables and assigning them values in Javascript.

I'm talking of course about the new keywords 'let' and 'const' that can be used in addition to 'var' and which makes things overly complicated when you are first learning the basics.

The keyword 'var' stands for variable (as you might've guessed) and it's simply how we can store values in Javascript. We create a variable and assign a certain value to it.

A value in this case can be anything from:

  - A number (called *integer*)
  - A series of characters or words (called a *string*)
  - A simple 'true' or 'false' value (called a *boolean*)
  - And a few others that we'll discuss later...

That same variable name can then be used instead of the value and we can use it to create our programming logic.

When using the 'var' keyword, a value that you set at the beginning of your Javascript file *could* be overwritten further down the page. This is the same when using 'let', but NOT 'const'. 'Const' (stands for 'constant') will throw an error as it's not a variable type that overwritten. That's really the only major difference between those 3 variable declarations.

If you want to feel like one of the cool ES6 kids, you *could* use the keyword 'let' instead of 'var' in your variable declarations and it would be the exact same thing, but I'd recommend NOT to. I believe it's better for your brain to grasp some of these earlier concepts if you just the keywords 'var' to re-inforce the idea that these are simply variables where we store some kind of value.
