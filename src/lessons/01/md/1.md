## Variables

First things first: One of the foundational principles of programming is how we store a value for later use.

A *variable* is how we **store values in Javascript**. You use the keyword `var` followed by a *single* equals sign (`=`) and whatever value you type to the right of the equals sign gets assigned to that particular variable name.

A value in this case can be of several different types. Let's take a look at some of the most common ones you'll likely use when you are first getting started:

### A number 
Any number or decimal can be stored in a Javascript variable (yes, even negative numbers!). Let's look a few examples:

~~~js
var roundNumber = 10;
var decimalNumber = 5.358;
var negativeNumber = -1;
~~~

Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's break down exactly what's happening above...

Like we mentioned above, the keyword `var` is used to create a variable (e.g. `roundNumber`) and then we **assign it** the value of 10 with the single equals (`=`) sign. Which by the way, is officially referred to as the **assignment operator** in Javascript.

At the very end of the line, you'll also see a semicolong character (`;`). This tells Javascript that this is the end of the line and to go ahead and move on to the next line down. This is an optional step but it's a good habit to get into as a beginner.

Also, a quick note about the naming convention for our variables. In the world of Javascript programming, it's standard practice to use a [camel case style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#:~:text=Camel%20case%20(stylized%20as%20camelCase,word%20starting%20with%20either%20case.) for writing variable names to make them as easy as possible to read. Your variable name should ideally describe the value that's getting stored.


### A string

A character, a word, or entire paragraphs can be assigned as a `string` value. Here's a couple of examples:

~~~js
var favoriteBookTitle = "The Alchemist";
var myName = 'John';
~~~

We use the exact same formatting as with numbers, except strings are always surrounded by quotes. Either *double* or *single* quotes will work here, it's a matter of personal preference.

### A boolean

Our third type is what we call a `boolean` and it refers to a simple `true` or `false` value. 

You've probably heard that computers break down all code into 1's and 0's, right?

Well, a boolean works on the same principle. Let's look at an example:

~~~js
var boredStatus = false;
var excitedStatus = true;
~~~


### Other types?

There are a few of other types of values that can be assigned to variables but we'll save those for a bit later once you start getting the hang of things...
