# How to play

The object of this game is simple. Just light up the rounded squares on the right side of the screen by typing in the correct Javascript code below. As you progress, it'll get relatively harder and you'll have to light up more blocks than one at a time.

That's it! Have fun and start learning Javascript and building your *own* cool stuff ðŸ˜‰
