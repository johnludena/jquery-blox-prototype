# Learn Javascript and jQuery By Playing a Puzzle Game!

Knowing Javascript as a front-end designer in 2021 is like having access to a super power that can completely change your life around in a very short period of time:
  - You could work for a marketing agency that gets to build an amazing Apple-style product landing page with lots of interactivity and things that really make their users say: "Woah, that was awesome" as they scroll down the page. And then scroll back up again just to experience it again.
  - You could work in your local city's hot startup where you'll get to build an innovative new product with a very polished and refined UI and UX eperience.
  - You could create your own indie games, VR game, or perhaps work at a AAA gaming studio. 

Yes, Javascript is everywhere and companies can't find qualified candidates fast enough. So when they do, they are compensated generously and the job of actually *making* things come alive can be incredibly rewarding.

And jQuery is still not going anywhere, no matter what all the techie snobs say, jQuery is still used in over 90% of websites all across the world for a reason: It's a Javascript library that is extremely easy to understand and read, and the perfect entry point to get you started in the world of programming.


## However, learning Javascript as a newbie is harder today than it was in the past before.

The state of Javascript is a complete cluster-fuck today. There are more tools and frameworks that keep coming out seemingly every other day, and it's a very tough road to get started as a newcomer.

Also, let's be honest here: 95% of YouTube tutorials out there are dry, boring, and run for hours without being edited so you can't learn practical knowledge quickly and efficiently. And they are just simply no fun.

On the other complete opposite of the expectrum, actual experts recording short screencasts assume you already know how to use the ES6 flavor of Javascript because it's shorter syntax and fast, but also the *least* readable version of Javascript. They also seem to go WAY too fast for beginners to even comprehend what the hell is going on half the time. It's almost like they've all forgotten what it was like to be a complete newbie at one point.

And for people that are jumping straight to try and learn an advanced framework (i.e. React.js) with zero programming experience just because it's "the new hotness", what they are doing is like trying to ride a motorcycle without knowing how to ride a bike. React is amazing, for more experienced developers. As a newbie, you are simply gonna have a bad time if you try do learn it without proper fundamentals and an easy to grasp concepts like a combination of plain Javascript and the jQuery library.

## Point: Learning by playing is the key. Like building an image puzzle(?), you do it one piece at a time starting with the easy wins.
- Talk about FACTS regarding gamification and interactivity as a learning system to make Javascript finally click for you.
- Talk about how we'll use a 80/20 strategy to teach your solid fundamentals and jQuery special recipes for creating almost any type of interactivity you'd ever need when creating something for the web.
- We'll show you real browser feedback that you could get while running that very same Javascript on your own projects. I'll show you how to start reading error messages to cut your debugging by a *large* amount.
- No super technical jargon or computer-sciency mumbo-jumbo here. The words "Foo" and "bar" are hereby banned from this point on. Carry on.
