# How to play

The object of this course is simple: Write the correct Javascript in the box below to light up the rounded squares on the right side of the screen.

As you progress, each lesson will get relatively harder and you'll have to light up more than one block at a time.

If your code submission doesn't work the first time, try switching to the "Results" tab to find out more about what could be source of the problem.

That's all there is to it.

Click the right arrow to get started with your first lesson.
