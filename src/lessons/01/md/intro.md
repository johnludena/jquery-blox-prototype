# Learn Javascript and jQuery By Playing a Puzzle Game!

Knowing Javascript as a front-end designer in 2021 is like having access to a super power that can completely change your life around in a very short period of time:

- Javascript is *the* language of interactivity in the web and can be used to build websites, software applications, mobile apps, VR experiences, and even games!
- If you alread know HTML and CSS and then learn even the basics of Javascript, you'll enter the mythical "Unicorn" territory. A very special -- and increasingly sought after -- role that companies value highly due to your ability to not just make things *work*, but make them work in a way that feels highly polished and with an eye for a great user-experience. A skill that is sorely lacking sometimes in hardcore developers and people that come from computer science backgrounds instead of more creative fields.
- [Javascript is still the #1 language in popularity with no signs of slowing down](http://www.google.com). 

Yes, Javascript is everywhere and companies can't find qualified candidates fast enough. So when they do, they are [compensated generously](http://www.google.com) and the job of actually *making* things come alive can be incredibly rewarding.

And jQuery is still not going anywhere, no matter what the techie snobs say, [jQuery is still used in over 90% of websites all across the world for a reason](http://www.google.com): It's a library that is extremely easy to read and understand, and the perfect entry point to get you started in the world of Javascript.


## However, the state of learning Javascript today is a complete cluster-fuck. 

There are more tools and frameworks that keep coming out seemingly every other day, and it's a very tough road to get started as a newcomer.

Also, let's be honest here: 95% of YouTube tutorials out there are dry, boring, and run for hours without being properly edited so you can't learn practical knowledge quickly and efficiently. Plus watching somebody code for a long time is simply no fun.

On the other complete opposite of the expectrum, actual experts recording very short screencasts assume you already know how to use the ES6 version of Javascript because it's shorter syntax and fast, but also the *least* readable version of the langauge. They also seem to go WAY too fast for beginners to even comprehend what the hell is going on half the time. 

And for people that are jumping straight to try and learn an advanced framework (i.e. React.js) with zero programming experience -- just because it's "the new hotness" -- it's akin to trying to learn how to ride a motorcycle without knowing how to ride a simple bicycle first. Simply put: If you follow this career strategy, you are gonna have a bad time.


## Gamification is the key. Like building an image puzzle, you do it one piece at a time starting with the easy wins first.

- Talk about FACTS regarding gamification and interactivity as a learning system to make Javascript finally click for you.

We'll use the 80/20 rule to help you understand some of the core concepts of Javascript and leverage the beginner-friendly jQuery library to help you create almost any type of interactivity you'd ever need when building stuff for the web.

Along the way, you'll get to try your own code and see real world feedback that you'd get inside your own browser when using your browser's developer tools. This will help you start understanding how to become a debugging pro and cut down your troubleshooting time by a large amount next time you have a problem.

As you can see, the whole point of gamification is to make things visual. Front-end designers (and the large majority of people) are *visual learners*, and no amount of 'foo' and 'bar' examples are gonna help. If anything, they make things more confusing sometimes. I promise you no super technical jargon or computer-sciency mumbo-jumbo here. The words "Foo" and "bar" are hereby banned from this point on.
