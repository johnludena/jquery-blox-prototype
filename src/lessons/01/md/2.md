## Coding Challenge:
Time for your very first test! ðŸ˜€

You'll see some code comments in the Javascript editor below. Any line that starts with double slashes (`//`) in Javascript will be considered a comment and will be ignored when your code gets compiled and executed. These comments are just another reminder of what the objective is to clear every lesson successfully.

For our very first exercise, create a variable called `firstName` and assign it your first name as a string value.
