## Variable values

As we discussed earlier, values can be assigned to variables.

There's many different values and formats, so it's important to know the difference.

Here's a few examples of all the types of values and their correct formatting in code:

  1. Strings

There's a few other important types (or 'data structures' as you'll sometimes hear them referred as) but as newbies, we'll stick with these for now until you feel a bit more confident with these simple concepts.
