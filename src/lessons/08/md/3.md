## The real hidden power of jQuery

But is that it? Do we just use jQuery because it's easier to read and faster to write?

Not *quite*.

Here's the real jQuery magic: By creating a node in this way, we are *wrapping* our little basic Javascript node **inside an object**. A very special and powerful jQuery-powered object in this case that allows you to do all kinds of fun stuff with very little jQuery code.

You could show and hide things, animate things, add or remove classes, etc. etc. And all with very few lines of code!

**That's** where jQuery shines and why it's still the people's champ of the Javascript world [still being used in over 77.6% of ALL websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery). Yes, even now in 2021, no matter what any of the tech hipsters may tell you.

In other words, jQuery is not going away anytime soon and it can act as the perfect set of "training wheels" when you are learning how to ride your new Javascript bicycle! üö¥üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Once you understand how jQuery works, doing a deeper dive at your own pace into more modern JS frameworks like React.js and others will be 100x easier!
