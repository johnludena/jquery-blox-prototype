## Loops

Loops are one of the quintessential concepts in programming. Without loops, we'd be screwed and doomed to an eternity of long and ardous data entry or repetitive tasks.

Thankfully, loops *do* exist and they help us do exactly that: Loop through items in an array. You can't loop through any other type, only arrays*.

Imagine you had a job doing data entry (a job I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy) and you had to do a menial, brainless task of grabbing all names in a text file with 10,000 full names and removing the last name.

How long would that take you? And how much would you be hating life at the end of the task and seriously re-considering your life choices up until that point?

Instead, imagine writing a simple function that would do the job for you. And all in a few milliseconds.

You could then spend the rest of the day looking for a better job.

That's why loops are so incredibly cool once you really start to understand them.

However, loops can be tricky to understand in the beginning, so we'll take it nice and easy and walk you through some helpful strategies to help you make your brain turn on the switch for 'loop mode'.

* = Not 100% true as you can also loop over a `NodeList` but that's a topic for another day. Pretend you didn't read this sentence for now and just associate loops with arrays for the time being.
