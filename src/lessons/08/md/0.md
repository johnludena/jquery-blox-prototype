## DOM Node Selections

Now that you have a crash course on Javascript basics, we've finally have come to the good stuff: How to make interactive things happen on the page!

This is when things start getting really fun and you get to actually *see* stuff happen on screen.

But first of all, let's quickly talk about a little thing called the DOM. What the heck is it first of all?

Well, if you recall how objects work from one of our previous lessons, the DOM is just that: One *giant* object that gets created after reading all your HTML, CSS, and Javascript files and then creating virtual "tree" representation of your HTML structure.

Put it this way: If your browser was a famous painter, your files would be the instructions to the painter as to what exactly to "paint" on the canvas, and the resulting picture would be called "the DOM".

I've written more about how this works [here](https://medium.com/@johnludena/javascript-for-designers-101-the-dom-an-illustrated-guide-9c3d60a7fe3). I highly suggest checking it out if you want to learn more about this topic.

So *why* is it necessary to understand what the DOM is in the first place?

It's important because when it comes to creating interactivity with elements on a page – like a button for example – we first need to look for that element and create **a DOM "node"** out of it. "Node" being just the Javascript way to refer to a variable that points to a real HTML element on the page.

In fact, creating a DOM node will always be your first step before doing anything else when making things interactive!
