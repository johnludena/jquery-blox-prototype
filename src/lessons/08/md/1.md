## Writing with plain vanilla JS can be a murder for your carpal tunnel sometimes.

The problem is that creating a DOM node using Javascript requires a lot more typing that it should and it's also not as easy to read, especially for people brand-new to the language.

For example, let's pretend we have the following HTML:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

We've been give a task that when the user clicks on the button, a hidden modal popup box will show up.

So first of all, we know that we need to interact with this button *somehow*. Therefore, what's our **very first step** when writing Javascript?

That's right, we need to create a DOM node for it! 

Let's first look at what that would look like in native Javascript though:

~~~~js
var buttonNode = document.querySelector('.btn');
~~~~

OK, maybe that's not too bad, but for a lot of newcomers, it's hard for them exactly what they are doing or exactly *why* they are writing things such as `document` or `querySelector`. 

And unfortunately it gets even worse from there.

However...
