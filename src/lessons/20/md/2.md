### Arrays

An array is a list of items. These can also be any valid Javascript value, just like objects. Arrays are declared by using square brackets (`[``]`), and each member of the array is separated by a comma.

The **index** is a number that is assigned to each member of the array and it starts at 0. To access the value of any member of an array we use the index number inside square brackets.

Example:

~~~js
var hobbies = ['Cycling', 'Reading and writing', 'Building things for the Internet', 'Learning a new language'];
var currentFavoriteHobby = hobbies[0]; // 'Cycling'
~~~

### Functions

A function is a collection of Javascript commands grouped together. This not only helps keep our code organized but prevents us from having to have repeated code when the steps to be followed are mostly the same.

A function's other key purpose is the ability to take an **input**, and return and **output**. We do this by passing a function **argument(s)** when the function is being called.

Example:

~~~js
function sayMyName(name){
	var output = 'Your name is ' + name;
	
	return output;
}

sayMyName('Heisenberg');
