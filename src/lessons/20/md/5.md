### The keyword 'this'

The keyword `this` is one of the trickiest things to understand for beginners and pros alike since its meaning can change based on the context of how it's being used. 

However, for our practical use cases when using it inside an event listener callback function, `this` refers to the HTML element where the event took place. In other words, if the user triggered a button with `click` event listener attached, using the `this` keyword inside of the callback function would refer to the button itself.

Example:

~~~html
<button class="btn">Click me to add active state</button> 
~~~

~~~js
var button = $('.btn');

button.on('click', function(){
	$(this).addClass('active');
});
~~~
