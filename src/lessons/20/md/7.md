### If/else statements

An `if/else` statement is how we check for conditions in Javascript. This allows us to *only* run certain blocks of code if certain rules are met. Otherwise, we can default to other code, or simply keep moving down the page.

We use **conditional operators** that are as simple as the math classes we took as kids. Here are some of the most common:

- Greater than (`>`)
- Greater or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Less or equal to (`<=`)
- Equals to (`===`)
- Not equals to (`!==`)

To make sure ALL conditions are met inside an if statement before executing, we use the AND operator (`&&`). However, if we only need ONE of the conditions to be true to execute our code, we use the OR operator (`||`).


Example:

~~~js
var button = $('.btn');

if(button.hasClass('active') === true) {
	console.log('Element already has "active" class.');
	// Run some code here
} else {
	console.log('Element does not already have "active" class.');
	// Run some different code instead
}
~~~
