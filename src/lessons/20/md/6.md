### Closest and Find

The `closest` and `find` jQuery methods are one of the easiest ways to traverse up or down the DOM tree to find the HTML node you are looking for and then doing something with it.

The `closest` method works by passing a valid CSS selector inside of it to search for as we go "up" in the hierarchy of HTML elements from the initial selection. The `find` method works in reverse: Going "down" the HTML hierarchy from the original jQuery object selection and trying to find a match in any of its nested children.

Examples:
~~~html
<div class="great-grandpa">
	<div class="grandpa">
		<div class="dad">
			<button>Find my crazy uncle</div>
		</div>
		<span class="uncle">Crazy Uncle</span>
	</div>
</div>
~~~

~~~js
var button = $('button');

button.on('click', function(){
	var crazyUncle = $(this).closest('.grandpa).find('.uncle');
	return crazyUncle; // will return '.uncle' span element
});
~~~
