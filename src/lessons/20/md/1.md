### Variables

A variable is a way to store values in Javascript. We use the keyword `var` followed by a descriptive name and the assignment operator (`=`) to store a particular value.

Example:

~~~js
var newJobTitle = "Designer and Developer Unicorn"
~~~

### Objects

An object is a way to group different sets of key/value pairs. We create an object by using the curly brackets (`{``}`) and we separate each set of key/value pairs with a comma.

The "keys" inside an object are called **properties** and are followed by a `:` character to set their values (as opposed to using the `=` in variables).

Each property can be any type of valid Javascript value: a string, a number, a boolean, another object, even a function (we call functions that are assigned to object properties **methods**).

Example:

~~~js
var petDog = {
	age: 3,
	name: "ChiChi",
	breed: "Mix",
	unlimitedEnergy: true,
	sayHello: function(){
		console.log('Woof woof!');
	}
}
