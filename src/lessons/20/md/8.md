### Loops

Loops in programming allow us to perform an action over a list of items in fractions of a second!

Using jQuery's `each` method allows us to loop over a list and manipulate each and every element in that list as needed with very little code.

Example:

~~~css
.card img {
	opacity: 0;
	transform: scale(1);
	transition: all .25s ease-in-out;
}

.card img.fadein-and-grow {
	opacity: 1;
	transform: scale(1.1);
}
~~~

~~~js
var cardImages = $('.card img'); // get all card images
cardImages.each(function(index, image){
	$(image).addClass('fadein-and-grow');
});
~~~
