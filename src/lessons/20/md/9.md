### Your Final Challenge

You just joined a new startup working on a sleek new investing app. The front-end team needs you to help them style some of data as shown to a user when they login into the desktop version to see how their portfolio is doing.

The task you've been assigned is to read the output HTML data for each stock position listed and show the number under the 'Gain/Loss' column either green if its positive, or red if it's negative. The team has already provided you with all the necessary CSS. The two classes that have been setup are called `gain` for green, and `loss` for red.

Write a script that will apply the correct class to each and every `span` HTML element where the 'Gain/Loss' number is being reported for all rows.

Here's the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/johnludena/pen/YzpmErb) you can reference with the full HTML and CSS styles provided. Use it as your testing playground and then paste your final answer below in order to successfully complete this challenge.
