### Never fly blind

One of the best not-so-well-kept secrets of any developer is setting small 'sanity-checks' along the way when coding in Javascript (or any programming language for that matter).

For example, you may wonder why your code doesn't appear to be executing at all, or perhaps why it's not running in the order you expected it and causing unexpected errors.

This is pretty much your job as a UI developer.

It's not about remembering how to exactly write everything in a particular programming language or knowing everything off the top of your head (trust me, looking stuff up on Google is sometimes 50% of the job!).

No. The real job of a developer is *being a problem solver*. 

Unfortunately, this is easier said than done as computers run large chunks of code within *milliseconds*. Which means that it's sometimes extremely hard for our monkey brains to try and comprehend exactly what the hell just happened sometimes.

Thankfully, just like a doctor has access to an x-ray machine to find out exactly what's going inside the body of a patient to try and diagnose their illness, we also have certain tools that can help us troubleshoot problems when coding in Javascript.
