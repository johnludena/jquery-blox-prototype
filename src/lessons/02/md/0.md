## Variable names

Remember than in even a small Javascript file can be perhaps hundreds of variables throughout it. It's thefore important that you name your variables that would make sense not just to you -- but more importantly -- other developers in your team.

And even if you plan on working on a tiny team or by yourself where you *think* it might not be important, trust me, it's critical to start setting good habits in your code from the very beginning.
