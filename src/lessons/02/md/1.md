Let's see if you can go two-for-two, OK? Create two variables with the guidelines below:

- Create a variable called `myAge` and set it to the integer value of your age today
- Create a variable called `programmingExp` and set it to either a boolean value of `true` or `false` based on your actual programming experience.
