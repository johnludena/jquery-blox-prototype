## Arrays

Remember we mentioned objects in one of our earliest chapters?

Arrays are another key concept to understand because they are so incredibly useful. 

So what *is* and array?

An array is a list, nothing more, nothing less.

It can be easily recognized because it uses a square brackets format (`[``[`] to surround a list of items separated by a comma.

Here's an example of a variable called `fruits` that has as its value an array of three items inside:

~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];
~~~

These items can be anything: Strings, numbers, booleans... even objects (if you recall them from one of our earlier lessons).

The trickiest part about arrays is making sure to understand about how their **order number** (or an array member's `index` as its called in Javascript) works when you want to access the information in a particular item in the array.

Let's check out the example below:

~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];

var firstFruit = fruits[0]; // 'Mango'
~~~


By using the name of the array variable and immediately following it with the array index inside **inside square brackets**, we can access the value for that particular array member.
