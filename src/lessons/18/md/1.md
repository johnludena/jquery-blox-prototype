### Array Index
But wait, what the heck is this "array index" though?

Just think of it as the designated ticket in line for each member of the array. In array-land, we always start counting at 0, so the very first array item gets an `index` of `0`.

Let's look at one more example:

~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];

var secondFruit = fruits[1];  // 'Apple'

~~~

If you were to `console.log` the value for `secondFruit`, you'd get the string `"Apple"`. And what would happen if instead of a 1, we used a 2? You guessed it, we'd get `"Pineapple"` instead. If you'd try to put a `3` as the index we'd get an error since there is no fourth array member (remember the index starts at zero).
