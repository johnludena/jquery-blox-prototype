## Objective:

Imagine you and your team are building a step tracker and you are in charge of a small piece of the UI.

Your task is to add a different `class` to the main circle `div` where the number of steps is shown by changing its color based on the actual amount indicated inside the HTML that the page displays.

The three classes are: `green`, `orange`, and `red` and they indicate how active (or inactive) the user has been for the day.

The requirements from the dev team are as follows:

1. If the number is 5000 or higher, add the `green` class.
2. If the number is between 2000 and 4999, add the `orange` class.
3. If the number is less than 1000, add the `red` class.

Another dev has already taken care of the first two lines for you so you already have an integer value of the steps taken directly from the HTML.

*Your* task is to complete this script by using the value of the variable `stepsCountNumber` and running the 3 conditions above.

Here's the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/johnludena/pen/bGBJwbm) you can reference with the full HTML and CSS styles provided. Use it as your testing playground and then paste your final answer below in order to successfully complete this challenge.
