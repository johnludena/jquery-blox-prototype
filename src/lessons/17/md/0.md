## Do you even `hasClass`?
Perhaps one of the most useful jQuery methods for doing conditional logic when working with DOM node selections is the `hasClass` method.

Using `hasClass` we can check for a string value to see if a DOM node already has that class or not, and then running a conditional block for each case. 

This keeps validation checks simple as we are just referring to the DOM tree to see what are the current states of certain elements (such as an `active` class state) by looking for this string amongst all existing CSS classes on an element.

Let's look at an example:

~~~html
<button>Check for 'active' class on modal</button>
<div id="overlay" class="active bg-white">Modal content</div>
~~~

~~~js
var button = $('button');
var overlay = $('#overlay');

button.on('click', function(){
	if (overlay.hasClass('active') === true) {
	// run some code if overlay already has class of 'active'
	} else {
	// run some other code if it doesn't
	}
});
~~~
