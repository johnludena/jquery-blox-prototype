## Coding Challenge:

The startup you are currently working at is implementing a new 'dark mode' feature for their app. They've tasked you with implementing the toggle UI functionality so that when the user clicks the toggle, two things happen:

1. We check if the checkbox input element already has a class of 'active' since dark mode can be enabled from another setting as well. If it *does*, then that means dark mode has already been turned on and we need to *remove* both the 'active' class from our input checkbox, as well as the 'dark-mode' class from the `body` HTML element (which helps cascade all other element styles for the page in 'dark mode').
2. Otherwise we do the exact opposite. If the input element does NOT have the class 'active' already, we *add* the class 'active' to the input itself, and then also add the 'dark-mode' class to the `body`.

Here's the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/johnludena/pen/MWbdgZO?editors=1111) you can reference with the full HTML and CSS styles provided. Use it as your testing playground and then paste your final answer below in order to successfully complete this challenge.
