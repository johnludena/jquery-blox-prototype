## removeClass

OK, now let's say your HTML on the page already has the button with a class of active. You could repeat the exact same process but use the `removeClass` method instead. Javascript would then remove that said class if it actually finds one attached to your element.

~~~html
<button class="btn active">learn more</button>
~~~

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    buttonNode.removeClass('active');
  });
~~~~
