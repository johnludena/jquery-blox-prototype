## addClass
Just like `hide` or `show`, `addClass` is a method of a jQuery object selection and it takes only one parameter: a string of the CSS class you want to add to your element.

And like everyday CSS, adding a class to an element will change the style according to the matching style inside our CSS file.

For example, let's say we want to set a button to an active state after the user clicks on it:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

~~~css
/* default button style */
.btn {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  transition: .2s ease-out background;
}
/* Active state of button */
.btn.active {
  background: red;
  color: white;
}
~~~

On initial page load, our button will have a blue background (our 'inactive' state).

However, what happens when we add the JS code below?

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    buttonNode.addClass('active');
  });
~~~~

Now after the user clicks on it, that element will get another class of `active` added, therefore taking on the CSS styles of the more specific `active` style for that same `btn` class inside our CSS stylesheet.

Not only that, but since the original `.btn` class has a `transition` property in CSS, once our Javascript code adds the additional 'active' class, the browser will transition the background from one color to create a neat effect!

Important: Please note that you ONLY write the string of the class name *itself* inside the `addClass` method, so no extra periods (`.`) are needed to specify this is actually a class selector. The `addClass` and `removeClass` methods are already expecting class names.
