## Objective:

You have been tasked with creating a mobile navigation with two requirements:

1. Once a user clicks the hamburger menu, the mobile menu should 'slide' from right to left.
2. At the same time, the hamburger menu will also change to an 'X' icon indicating that the next click will close the menu.

All the CSS you require has already been provided. Your only job is to write the required Javascript to make this work.

Here's the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/johnludena/pen/yLVxpaq) you can reference with the full HTML and CSS styles. Use it as your testing playground and then paste your final answer below in order to successfully complete this challenge.
