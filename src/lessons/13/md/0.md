## Adding and removing classes with jQuery

As we saw in our last chapter, `hide` and `show` are very simple and easy to use â€“ with perhaps one fault: they are a little heavy-handed when it comes to making more subtle or refined interactions. After all, all they are doing are toggling a `display` CSS property to either `none` or `block` respectively.

However, we could also use the `addClass` and `removeClass` methods to update classes instead!

Adding or removing classes is an extremely powerful technique to make custom interactions incredibly easy by letting our CSS do the heavy lifting instead and give us much more control over animations and the entire user-experience.
