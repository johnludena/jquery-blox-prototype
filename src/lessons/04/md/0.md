## Arrays
An array is simply a list, nothing more, nothing less. It can be easily recognized because it uses a square brackets format to surround a list of items separated by a comma.

~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];
~~~

These items can be anyhing: Strings, numbers, booleans... even objects!

The trickiest part about arrays is making sure to understand about how their **order number** (or an array member's `index` as its called in Javascript) works when you want to access the information in a particular item in the array.

So here's an example to show we can access the value of a single array item:

~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];

var firstFruit = fruits[0]; // 'Mango'
~~~


You see that? By using the name of the array variable and immediately following it **square brackets** -- the opening `[` and closing `]` -- with the array index inside (discussed next), we can access the value for that particular array member.
