## Objects

In addition to numbers, strings, and booleans, another type of variable that you'll encounter in Javascript is called an **object**. While they may sound intimidating, they are actually pretty easy to understand: Just think of objects as groupings of **key and value pairs**.

Object are defined by using the curly brackets (`{` to open the object and `}` to close it). 

Inside this object, we can only place key/value pairs. 

The keys inside objects are called *properties* and the values are exactly that: the value that you'll be assigning to this key, just like we were doing it earlier when assigning a value to a variable.

Let's take a look a simple object that has a few different sets of properties and value pairs:

~~~js
var avatarProfile = {
  name: "Stan Smith",
  height: "6'0",
  age: 42,
  weight: "195 lbs.",
  interests: "America"
};
~~~

Also, it's important to note that since objects can have multiple properties, you use a comma (`,`) after the property's value to separate every pair â€“ with the exception of the last one (it's more or less optional).

So in summary: Objects are simply how we make sense of things by grouping a bunch of properties and their values together into one tidy and organized unit.
