## Arrays
An array is simply a list, nothing more, nothing less. It can be easily recognized because it uses a brackets format to encapsulated a list of items separated by a comma.

`var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];`

Now these items can be anyhing: Strings, numbers, booleans, even objects.

The trickiest part about arrays, is making sure to understand how the indexes work when you want to access the informaition in an array member (i.e. a single item in the array).

Here's how we read the value of an array's item:

`var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];

var firstFruit = fruits[0];`

You see that? By using the name of the array variable and immediately following it by brackets with the array index, we can access the value for that particular array member.

If you were to `console.log` the value for `firstFruit`, you'd get the string `Mango`. And what would happen if instead of a 0, we used a 1? You guessed it, we'd get `Apple` instead.

Simple enough, right?
