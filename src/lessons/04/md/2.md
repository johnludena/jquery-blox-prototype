## Objective: 

Let's test your new Object and Array's knowledge.

Create an array called `topFive` with 5 of your closest friends. They should all be string value names. Also, make absolutely sure your array has *exactly* 5 items to pass this test correctly.

Then create a second variable called `middleFriend` and assign the value of the **third array member**.
