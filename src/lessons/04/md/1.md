## Objective:

Think of your dream car for a second. What year, make, model, and color is it?

Got it? Awesome. Now, we'll use that to create your first object in Javascript.

Create a variable called 'myDreamCar' and set its value to an object with the following: 
- A `year` property that has an `integer` value with your car's year.
- A `make` property with the car's make as a `string` value.
- A `model` property with your car's model as a `string` value.
- A `color` property with your car's favorite color as a `string` value.
