### Array Index
What the heck is this "array index" though? Just think of it as the designated ticket in line for each member of the array. In computer-land, we usually start at 0, so the very first array item gets an `index` of `0`. And yes, like you saw in the example, that's the `number` zero (not a `string` of zero).


Let's look at one more example:
~~~js
var fruits = ['Mango', 'Apple', 'Pineapple'];

var secondFruit = fruits[1];  // 'Apple'

~~~

If you were to `console.log` the value for `secondFruit`, you'd get the string `"Apple"`. And what would happen if instead of a 1, we used a 2? You guessed it, we'd get `"Pineapple"` instead. If you'd try to put a `3` as the index we'd get an error since there is no fourth array member (remember the index starts at zero).

Not too bad, right?
