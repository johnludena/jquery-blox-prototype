## Variable names

Remember, there's no extra points to see who can write the same answer in less lines of code.

By naming things appropriately and making your code as easy as ready to *another* human being, you will not only prevent other developers in your team from secretly hating you, but it'll also help *you* out when you return to a project after a while and need to refresh your memory on what the hell your own code is doing.

People that write messy, unorganized code with little attention to readability will always screw themselves in the end. So please don't be that person.

Also, don't be afraid to use `//` to write comments as notes for yourself and others about what's happening in your code. Especially as you file starts growing and your logic starts getting more and more advanced.
