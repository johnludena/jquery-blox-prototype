## Objects

Think of objects as groupings of key/value pairs. What's a key/value pair you might ask? Excellent question.

Key/value pairs are just a set of a *key* (called 'property' in Javascript) and a *value* that corresponds to that property. Just think of properties and values inside an object like peanut butter & jelly. They just work together all the time, and can only be found inside objects.

Let's take a look a simple object example that has a few different set of properties and value pairs:

~~~js
var girlfriendProfile = {
  ethnicity: "latina",
  height: "5' - 5'4",
  age: "Between 24 - 40",
  bodyType: "Athletic, feminine with some curves"
}
~~~

See that? 

There's a few things more to objects than this but since we won't be focusing on them too much during this short interactive course -- so we can focus instead on more practical concepts -- we'll leave them here for now. Just remember that objects are simply how we make sense of things by grouping a bunch of properties and their values together into one unit.
