## Objective:

Think of your dream car for a second. What year, make, model, and color is it?

Got it? Great. Now, we'll use that to create your first object in Javascript.

Create a variable called 'myDreamCar' and set its value to an object with the following properties: 'year', 'make', 'model', 'color'. Each property should have a valid string value assigned to it. (e.g. make: "Audi")
