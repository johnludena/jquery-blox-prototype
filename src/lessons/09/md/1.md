### Hide

OK, let's go for a double whammy here. But what if you want to *close* the modal? Well, let's pretend we have another button inside of your modal:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
<div class="modal-popup" style="display: none">
  <p>Your modal content here</p>
  <button class="close-modal">close</button>
</div>
~~~

It's a simple matter of doing the exact same thing as above but attaching another little 'ear' (i.e. event listener) to a closing button node, but this time instead of using `show`, we'll use `hide` to set the inline style CSS to `display: none`. That's all there is to `hide`.

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');
  var closeModalButton = $('.close-modal');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').show();
  });

  closeModalButton.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').hide();
  });
~~~~

That's all there is to it!

Are you starting to see the power of Javascript and jQuery when used together? Remember that almost every interaction when doing UI work is some type of hiding and showing stuff. With `show` and `hide` you'll be appear like a JS pro in no time at all.
