## Objective: 

Let's say we have a button and we want to run a message as a `console.log` statement when we click it to perform a sanity check in our code and make sure our function is being executed.

~~~html
<button class="btn">Click to upvote</button>
~~~

Using jQuery, attach a 'click' event to this button so that a callback function named `showFeedback` logs the message 'Upvoted!' to the console.
