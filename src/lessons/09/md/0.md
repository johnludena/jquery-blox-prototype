## Become a jQuery Magician with Show/Hide

- Fool everybody into thinking you actually know Javascript with two simple jQuery methods: `hide` and `show`. 

- When you think about it, almost every interaction on a page is based on hiding and showing stuff. You click here, this appears and something else gets hidden. It's a functionality used across multiple types of website pieces (or components if you want to put your nerdy hat on). Things like modals, tabs, accordions, sliders, etc. They ALL work on this very simple premise.

- With jQuery's `hide` and `show` methods, you'll be a JS wiz kid in no time at all. Let's look at an example of how to use them.

### Show
First let's take a look at `show`:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
<div class="modal-popup" style="display: none">
  <p>Your modal content here<p>
</div>
~~~

~~~~js
  var buttonNode = $('.btn');

  buttonNode.on('click', function(){
    $('.modal-popup').show();
  });
~~~~

Hopefully, you can kinda tell what's happening here. Your HTML has a button that reads 'learn more' and also a hidden modal popup where you'll school the user on some stuff. Now the modal is hidden by default on page load due to the inline `style` tag that has `display: none` set.

However, just like we did in a previous lesson, we'll add a `click` event listener to our button, and inside our callback function, we'll actually reveal the `.modal-popup` div element. You know how exactly? Easy: All `show` does is set an inline style tag to `display: block`. Voila! Like magic you'll `div` will now show up on click.
