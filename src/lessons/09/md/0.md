## Event Listeners

OK, so we have a DOM node. Now what?

Well, here is where things start getting really fun. Now we can make UI interactions by using an **event listener** on our jQuery node.

Think of event listeners as "tiny little ears" we can attach to any DOM node. These ears will sit there and listen for a specific action from the user such as a click, hover, etc.).

We call these "events" in Javascript.

Keep in mind that these can be applied to *any* element, not just clickable elements like a `button` or `a` tags!

Now, here is a [very long list of supported event listener types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) to satisfy a developer's wildest dreams, but for the scope of this short introductory course, we'll stick with one that you'll use almost 90% of the time: the popular `click` event.

Let's look at an example of how we can attach an event listener to a jQuery button node so we can run a `function` called `saySomething` after the user clicks on the button. 

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn'); 

function saySomething() {
	console.log('That tickles!');
}

buttonNode.on('click', saySomething); 
~~~

Think of the jQuery `on` method as basically a built-in function of every jQuery selection where we can pass 2 parameters:
- The first is the *type* of event to listen for (e.g. `click`)
- The second is the *function* that will run once the click has been triggered. This is called a **callback function**, a function that runs *inside* another function. We'll expand a bit more on this in an upcoming lesson.
