## Closest

When using `closest`, jQuery will start going *up* the DOM tree hierarchy from where your original node is and find a matching selector that you pass as a parameter (similar to `addClass` or `removeClass`). The only difference is that instead of a plain string, you need to pass it the full CSS selector (e.g. '`.submenu` for classes).

Once jQuery has a match, it'll stop there and put its focus on that element instead. At that point you'll have access to any and all jQuery methods to use on that newly found selection instead.

Let's look at a simple example of this:

~~~html
<div class="grandpa-wrapper">
  <div class="parent-wrapper">

    <button>find my grandpa</button>
  </div>

</div>

~~~

~~~js
$('button').closest('.grandpa-wrapper');
~~~

The above jQuery selection will first look at the button node, then start going *up* the DOM tree, go past the `parent-wrapper` container 'div' and then hit the `.grandpa-wrapper` element.

At that point, we now have our focus on the `.grandpa-wrapper` element and can use any of the jQuery methods mentioned before (`hide`, `show`, `addClass`, `removeClass`, etc.) to change it as we need to.
