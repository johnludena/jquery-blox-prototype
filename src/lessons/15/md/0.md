## Closest and find

Remember when we talked about how the DOM was basically one giant object created from all the elements in your page?

Well, since our page (aka our 'document') can have many nested tags like `div`s inside of other `div`s, multiple `li`'s inside a `ul` and infinite other combinations based on what you need your page's structure to look like, our DOM object also nests all those elements as properties and it starts resembling a virtual tree of sorts with multiple levels of nested branches. 

And it's for this reason it's very important to know how to 'move up' or 'move down' the tree to find the right element you are looking for inside those branches.

In other words, think of it like a much nicer game of 'search & destroy.' We are not destroying anything of course, we are just looking up and down the DOM tree until we find the right HTML element to do cool stuff with.
