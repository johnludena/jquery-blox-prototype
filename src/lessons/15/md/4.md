### Putting it all together
Now let's go back to our original ask. Show the correct submenu for each `a` tag inside a navigation list.


~~~html
<ul class="menu-navigation">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Home</a>
    <div class="submenu" style="display: none">Submenu content</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">About</a>
    <div class="submenu" style="display: none">Submenu content</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Services</a>
    <div class="submenu" style="display: none">Submenu content</div>
    </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Contact</a>
    <div class="submenu" style="display: none">Submenu content</div>
  </li>
</ul>
~~~


~~~js
$('.menu-navigation > li > a').on('click', function(){
  $(this).closest('li').find('.submenu').show();
});
~~~

Using the keywords `this` that we discussed in our previous chapter, we first tell Javascript to create an object selection of where the click event took place -- in this case, our `a` tag.

Next, we traverse up the DOM tree until we find its immediate parent `li` element, and then we drill down to find our desired `submenu`. This is usually referred to as **chaining** methods together.

Now that we have finally locked in to our desired target like a Terminator about to exterminate its victim, we can then finally show our `.submenu` div container by using the `show` method and toggling it's style to `display: block`, therefore revealing our submenu container ONLY for that particular menu item!

And guess what? You now have a fully functional navigation with submenu drop-downs that can support any type of content in 3 lines of JS. How cool is that?
