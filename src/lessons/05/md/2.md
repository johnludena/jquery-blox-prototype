## The Hero We Don't Deserve
Now look at this. The same node selection but with jQuery instead:

~~~js
var buttonNode = $('.btn');
~~~

Yes, the almighty $ symbol is the way to access the power of jQuery. [Once you have loaded the jQuery library](http://www.google.com) before your own script file before the end of the `</body>` tag, you'll be able to use jQuery's magic in this way.

The `$` symbold followed by an opening `(` and closing `)` is how you tell jQuery that you are looking for a specific DOM node. What goes inside is the CSS selector you want. And like CSS, remember you can also pass it the `button` HTML selector and it would also work. Basically any valid CSS selector will also work here to find that node and create it.

However, I'd caution to be careful here as you can get the wrong selection if the CSS selector you are looking for is too general. For example, if you had more than two `button` elements on the page and you were trying to target the second one with just a `button` jQuery selector without passing it a more specific ID or class, Javascript would create a node of the very *first* matching node it created, in this case the first button and not your second one.

Other than that, that's as simple as it gets!

But is that it? Do we just use jQuery because it's easier to read and faster to write?

Not really.

By creating a node in this way, we are *wrapping* our little, basic-ass Javascript node **inside an object**. A very special jQuery-powered object in this case that allows you to do all kinds of fun stuff with very cool jQuery code.

That's where jQuery shines and why it's still the people's champ of the Javascript library world.
