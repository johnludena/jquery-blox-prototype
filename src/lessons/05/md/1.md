## Objective:

Let's say that we have the object below inside a variable called `juniorDeveloperJob`. 


~~~js
	var juniorDeveloperJob = {
		yearsOfExpReq: 2,
		startingSalary: '60k to 70k',
		location: 'Houston, TX'		
~~~


Your task is to create a variable called `expRequired` and assign it the value of the `yearsOfExReq` property with either dot notation or bracket notation and **log that value to the console.**
