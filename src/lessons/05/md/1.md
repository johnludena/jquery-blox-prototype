## Writing with plain vanilla JS can be a murder for your carpal tunnel sometimes.

When using good ol' plain Javascript without any fancy upgrades or libraries means that creating a DOM node requires a lot more typing that it should. At least compared to a library like jQuery.

For example, let's pretend we have the following HTML:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

Clicking this button will trigger a hidden modal popup box (eventually). 

But we need that we'll interact with this button *somehow* so what's our **very first step** when writing Javascript?

That's right! We need to create a DOM node for it! But in old and humble Javascript, this is one of the simplest ways to do it:

~~~~js
var buttonNode = document.querySelector('.btn');
~~~~

Maybe that's not to bad, but for a lot of newcomers to Javascript, it's hard for them exactly what they are doing or exactly why they are writing things such as `document` or `querySelector`.
