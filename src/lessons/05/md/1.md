## Anonymous functions
One last thing before we move on: While we stated above that functions use the keyword `function` followed by a name you make up, there's also another type of function. A shy type that doesn't have a name, and these go by the name of 'anonymous' functions in Javascript.

Anonymous functions are just functions with no specific name given. The most common way an anonymous function is used in Javascript is by first storing itself in a variable. At that point the variable and the function are basically one and the same, and you can execute/run/call/invoke your function by calling your variable name followed by the `()` just like you would on a regular function.

Here's a quick example to show this:

~~~~js
var sayMyNameSayMyName = function (yourName){
  return 'Hi, my name is ' + yourName;
}

sayMyNameSayMyName('John');
~~~~

We'll see an example of this later on but just keep this in the back of your mind for now.
