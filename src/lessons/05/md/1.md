## Writing with plain vanilla JS can be a murder for your carpal tunnel sometimes.

When using good ol' plain Javascript without any fancy upgrades or libraries means that creating a DOM node requires a lot more typing that it should. At least compared to a library like jQuery.

For example, let's go back to our button example:

~~~html
<button class="btn">learn more</button>
~~~

Clicking this button will trigger a hidden modal popup box (eventually). What's our first step? That's right, creating a DOM node for it! But in old and humble Javascript, this is one way of the simplest ways to do it:

~~~~js
var buttonNode = document.querySelector('.btn');
~~~~

Maybe that's not to bad, but in my mind it opens up a lot of questions for most newbies that quite frankly it's better to wait until things start clicking for you and the `document.querySelector` part starts making more sense.
