## Accessing object properties

OK, so we know how to define an object with properties and value. But how do actually access values inside said object?

There's two ways to do this:
- Dot notation
- Bracket notation

Let's look at an example based on an object called `gamingAvatar`:

~~~js

var gamingAvatar = {
	name: 'JohnnyFiiive',
	accountAgeInYears: 2.5,
	daysSinceLastLogin: 3
}

var myAvatarName = gamingAvatar.name; 
var alsoMyAvatarName = gamingAvatar.name[name]
console.log(name); // Console output: 'JohnnyFiiive'
console.log(nameAlt); // Console output: 'JohnnyFiiive'
~~~

When using **dot notation**, we simply use the main object's variable name, followed by a period (`.`) and the property *name*.

When using **bracket notation**, we again use the main object's variable name, but instead use the property name inside square brackets (`[`,`]`). This becomes extremely useful particularly when using a variable name as a property, but don't worry too much about that for the now. 

Again, both are perfectly valid ways to access an object's value but I'd recommend you use dot notation while you are still getting started.
