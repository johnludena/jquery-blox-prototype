## DOM Node Selections

Now that you have a crash course on Javascript basiscs, we finally have come to the good stuff, how to make interactive things happen on the page!

*This* is where we'll finally be leveraging jQuery to help us make pretty much anything.

First of all, let's talk about a little thing called the DOM. What the heck is it first of all?

The DOM is simply a giant object that is made up of *everything* in your page. Yes, your buttons, images, headings, p tags, and everything in between. 

The DOM is basically one giant-ass object that gets created after reading all your HTML, CSS, and files. If your browser was a famous painter, your files would be the instructions of what to "paint" on the screen, and the resulting picture would be the work of art on the canvas at the end.

But *why* is it necessary to understand what the DOM is?

Great question. It's important because when it comes to creating interactivity with elements on a page -- like a button for example -- we first need to look for that element and create **a DOM "node"** out of it. "Node" being just the Javascript way to refer to a variable that points to a real HTML element on the page.

You see, *everything* in a page can potentially be turned into a node. In fact, it's absolutely step number one before you can do *anything* else. If you don't create a DOM node first, your browser has no freakin' clue as to where to apply all the Javascirpt goodness you got in store for it.
