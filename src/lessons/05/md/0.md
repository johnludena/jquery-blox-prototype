## DOM Node Selections

## Now that you have a crash course on JS basiscs, we finally have come to the good stuff, how to make interactive things happen on the page! *This* is where we'll finally be leveraging jQuery to help us make pretty much anything.
- Explain about what the DOM is
- Explain that pretty much every element on a page can be a node
- Eplain why we need to create a DOM node as the very first step before we can interact with that particular element (e.g. before we add interactivity for a button, we need to tell the browser that we need a node built out of it first)

## Writing with plain vanilla JS can sometimes be overly verbose and intimidating for newbies.
- Show example of a DOM node selection with just plain normal Javascript
- Talk briefly about how the user will understand what this is later down the journey, but this is basically how to create a DOM node to later do something with.
- Talk about why this is very verbose and requires a lot more typing than using jQuery.

## jQuery to the rescue!
- Show same example with just plain jQuery
- Talk about what jQuery is (an object wrapper for a DOM node with several different built-in methods)
- Talk about why I think most people will have an easier time understanding jQuery due to it's CSS-like syntax. Talk about CSS selectors and -- just like CSS -- to be careful with your selectors to prevent being overly general.
