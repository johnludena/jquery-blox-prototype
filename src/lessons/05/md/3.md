## Objective: 

Let's pretend that we have the following HTML on a page:

~~~html
<button class="btn blue">learn more</button>
~~~

Create a DOM node out of this button and assign it to a variable called `blueButton`. **Remember that there are multiple ways you coudl target this element**. There is no one right answer on this way, there's multiple correct ways to do it!
