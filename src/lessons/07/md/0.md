## Methods

One word you will keep running into while learning Javascript is a **method**. This might throw you off in the beginning, but all a method really is just a **function that's assigned to an object's property**.

Remember what we talked about during our objects lesson?

Object properties can have any type of value: Strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and yes... even functions!

Well, when that happens, we call those properties 'methods'.

Let's take a look at one of our previous examples with a new method called `startTheShow`.

~~~js
var avatarProfile = {
  name: "Stan Smith",
  height: "6'0",
  age: 42,
  weight: "195 lbs.",
  interests: "America",
  startTheShow: function(){
	  console.log("Good morning U-S-A! I got a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day...")
  }
}
~~~

Now we have added a `startTheShow` property which has a function assigned as the value. And what does this function do? Well, in this case it just logs a message to the console.

Wait, but HOW the hell are we supposed to call this object's 'method'?

Well, we access that property via dot notation and then execute the function using the opening and closing parenthesis `(``)` just like we would any other function. Nothing else has changed in terms of how functions work in this case.

Let's look at another example:

~~~
avatarProfile.startTheShow(); // Console output: "Good morning U-S-A! I got a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day..."
~~~

Does that make sense? When it comes down to it, a method is really just a function that lives inside an object as a property.
