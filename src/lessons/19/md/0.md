## Loops

Imagine you had a job doing data entry (a job I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy) and you had to do a menial, brainless task of grabbing all names in an Excel file with 100,000 full names and splitting each and every one into a "First Name" and "Last Name" fields.

How long would that take you? And how seriously would you be re-considering your life choices up until that point?

Instead, imagine writing a simple function that would do the job for you. And all in a few *milliseconds* instead of days. You could then spend the rest of the day looking for a better job.

**That' why loops are so incredibly powerful** once you really start to understand them.

However, loops can be *a bit* tricky to understand in the beginning, so we'll take it nice and easy and walk you through some helpful strategies to help you make your brain turn on the switch for 'loop mode'.
