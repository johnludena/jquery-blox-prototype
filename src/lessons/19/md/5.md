## Coding Challenge:

You've been tasked with making sure that all links in a company's new product documentation online have an external arrow next to them so that users understand these are external resources and will open up a new tab when clicked.

The front-end team has already provided you with the correct CSS styling for a class called `external-link`. Your job is to create a script that will loop through ALL links on a page and will add this class only if said link opens up in a new tab.

Remember that you can't modify the HTML provided (as there could be *hundreds* of pages of documentation and this process needs to be automated). The CSS provided should also stay as it is.

Here's the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/johnludena/pen/oNYKKdj) you can reference with the full HTML and CSS styles provided. Use it as your testing playground and then paste your final answer below in order to successfully complete this challenge.
