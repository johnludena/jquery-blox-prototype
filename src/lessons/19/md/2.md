## The index parameter
The first parameter is the current index value of the array member. If you recall from our previous lesson, every array item has an index 'key' associated with it. The first item in the array has an index of 0, the next one is 1, etc. 

In other words, as we are looping through the array, one of the parameters that'll be available for us to use if we ever need it (trust me, you'll need it eventually) is the index for the current array item being looped over.

Keep in mind that as we've discussed before, parameter names can be named whatever your heart desires, but it's pretty common for developers to name the index parameter `i` for short instead of `index` like we are doing here. (they are both perfectly acceptable parameter names).
